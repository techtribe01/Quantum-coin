# Quantum-coin

## Overview
Quantum-coin is a project developed for hackathon innovation by the techtribe01 team. It explores concepts of quantum-influenced digital currency and features a TypeScript-heavy codebase (99.5%) for ease of use and future extensibility[attached_file:1].

## Project Goals
- Design and prototype a digital currency system leveraging quantum-inspired cryptography.
- Showcase practical applications and algorithms suitable for hackathon demonstrations.
- Enable experimentation and learning for developers in secure, scalable currency platforms.

## Features
- Written in **TypeScript** for reliability and clarity.
- Implements fundamental quantum-resistant logic (expandable as needed).
- Structured for hackathon environments: fast setup, simple contributions, and open collaboration.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:


2. Explore the source files for examples and API usage.
3. Fork and contribute features or bug fixesâ€”collaboration is encouraged!

## Hackathon Context
Developed by techtribe01 as part of a hackathon initiative, this project draws on the experience of team members like Manoj Kumar Thammisetti, a student ambassador focused on AI, ML, and secure development practices. The repository fosters teamwork, creativity, and technical learning relevant for hackathon competitions[1].
